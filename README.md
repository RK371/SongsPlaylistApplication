# Songs_Playlist_Application
A Web App to store your favorite songs along with the name of the artist and the Spotify link to it.

## Project Description 
The web application will serve as a Songs Playlist platform catering to music enthusiasts of all ages. Its primary purpose is to provide users with a centralized hub to create, customize, and enjoy personalized playlists. Targeted at music lovers who value organization and accessibility, the application will offer features such as dynamic song display, CRUD operations for playlist management, and seamless integration with Spotify for enhanced music discovery.

## Architectural Overview 
The front end of the web application will be developed using JavaServer Pages (JSP), providing a dynamic and interactive user interface. Servlets will handle the back-end logic, processing user requests and interacting with the data storage system. XML will be utilized for data storage, storing information about songs, playlists, and user preferences.
